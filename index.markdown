# Hello! 

I am a Research Associate at the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) and an adjunct professor at the [Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. 


## Bio: 

Jeremy Seeman is a Research Associate in the Data Governance and Privacy group at the Urban Institute, an adjunct professor at the [Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, and an affiliate faculty member of the [Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC)](https://esc.umich.edu). 

Jeremy's research focuses on technical and policy solutions for responsible data sharing, with an emphasis on deploying and governing privacy-enhancing technologies to responsibly expand access to sensitive public good data sources. His work has been featured in numerous interdisciplinary venues including statistics, computer science, law, philosophy, and policy. Jeremy's work develops privacy-ehnacing data sharing solutions for numerous public good organizations, including the National Science Foundation, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 

Before joining Urban, Seeman was a Michigan Data Science Fellow at the University of Michigan. He received his BS in physics and MS in statistics from the University of Chicago and his PhD in statistics from Penn State University, where he was a U.S. Census Bureau Dissertation Fellow.
